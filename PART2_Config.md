# Git and GitHub: Configuration  
[.bashrc](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html) | [Settings the PS1](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/setps.html) |  
Global and Local settings allow us to customize particular
repositories.  

List all settings  
```bash
git config --list
```  
To view your global settings for many tools can be found in your system's home directory. The following commands in a bash terminal will perform the same thing.   
```bash
vim ~/.gitconfig
vim $HOME/.gitconfig
```  
Dotfiles are files beginning with a dot (.), which are 'hidden files' and are generally used for customizing settings.  
  
We use terminal a lot when developing. Bash (the Bourne Again Shell) is a shell we use in the
terminal, and a [scripting language](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-bash/) (like Ruby). There are [alternative shells](http://www.interworx.com/community/alternative-shells-for-linux/), such as zsh, ksh.  
  
Mac OS X runs its Terminal.app a little differently from most other GUI
terminals, and a [recommended
setting](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html) for your .bash_profile is to add
the following  
```bash
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi
```  
This script is pretty easy to undertand, and basically says "If there is
a file in the home directory .bashrc, then use it as the source."  
  
There are some intended [differences between .bashrc and
.bash_profile](http://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile),
however for the scope of this course, we will only be using the .bashrc
file for setting alsiases, setting up our default editors, and system
output colors, etc.  
  
## Setting the PS1  
We can customize the command prompt in Bash using PS1="something". To
see the current code behind your prompt, try `echo $PS1`.  
  
You can make your command prompt look different for the current session
with `PS1="Hello: "`. We can set up our command line to give more
[meaningful
information](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/09/bash-shell-ps1-10-examples-to-make-your-linux-prompt-like-angelina-jolie/). For example, if we wish to show the current git branch we are on, and its status, we can use a script like [.git_svn_bash_prompt.sh](https://gist.github.com/woods/31967) from Scott Woods, and customize it a little to suit our needs.  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
#   Set the bash prompt according to:
#    * the branch/status of the current git repository
#    * the branch of the current subversion repository
#    * the return value of the previous command
# 
# USAGE:
#
#   1. Save this file as ~/.git_svn_bash_prompt
#   2. Add the following line to the end of your ~/.profile or
~/.bash_profile:
#        . ~/.git_svn_bash_prompt

## Git Config Settings

Global and Local config settings allow us to specify if we want to use
the same default settings on all projects (Global), or *override* those
settings locally.  
  
To view your current settings run `git config --list`. By default, you
will be using your global settings. If you haven't set them up yet, or
if you want to change them, you can set your username and email (this
will be associated with any commits you make).  
```bash
git config global u.name drew
git config global u.email drew@drewbro.com

# or locally
git config local u.name drew
git config local u.email 123and@gmail.com
```  
Similarly, to set git to a color user interface, you can run `git config
--global color.ui true`.  
  

View settings files globally `cat ~/.gitconfig` or locally
`.git/config`.  

## Add Remote Repositories  
If you already have remote repositories set up, you can see them by
running the command `git remote -v`. This will display all remote
repositories you are currently connected to. Git has a Master branch,
and by default, we call our remote repository 'origin'. However, if you
have multiple remotes, you will have different names for each.  
  
For example, if you have a remote repository on heroku, it will be
called 'heroku' rather than remote. An example list of remote repose may
look like this  
```bash
bb https://drewbro@bitbucket.org/drewbro/my_website.git (fetch)
bb https://drewbro@bitbucket.org/drewbro/my_website.git (push)
gh git@github.com:ogryzek/my_website.git (fetch)
gh git@github.com:ogryzek/ogryzek/my_website.git (push)
heroku git@heroku.com:my_website.git (fetch)
heroku git@heroku.com:my_website.git (push)
```  
  
## Push, Pull, Merge, Fetch & Rebase  
Locally, we can create a new branch and checkout to it with `git
checkout -b my_branch`. After we've made changes we are satisfied with,
we can add and commit then, then checkout to the Master branch and
merge: `git merge my_branch`.  
  
When working with remote repos, especially in collaboration with other, we often push our branch up to the
remote, then request that it be merged to the master branch.  
  
If we want to pull any changes that may have been merged with master
since we last pulled from the remote origin, we can do `git pull origin
master`.  
  
Git fetch acts a little differently. When we 'fetch' we pull the latest
changes and are able to checkout other branches, or merge. Typically, we
can do  
```bash
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
```  
***Note***  
```bash
git pull = git fetch + git merge              # against tracking upstream branch.

git pull --rebase =  git fetch + git rebase   # against tracking upstream
branch.
```  
We can use `git pull --rebase` as a shorthand for this.
